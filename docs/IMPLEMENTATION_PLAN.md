## Key Components to Build

### Core Components
```typescript
// Layout Components
<App />
<Header />
<AircraftTabs />
<WeightSummary />

// Input Components
<WeightTile />
<FuelTile />
<LoadingStationGrid />

// Visualization Components

  model: string;
  emptyWeight: number;
  emptyCG: number;
  maxWeight: number;
  maxLandingWeight: number;
  fuelCapacity: number;
  envelope: CGEnvelopePoint[];
  stations: LoadingStation[];
}

interface LoadingState {
  pilot: number;
  frontPassenger: number;
  rearPassenger1: number;
  rearPassenger2: number;
  baggageA: number;
  baggageB: number;
  baggageC: number;

}
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Calculation Accuracy
- Cross-reference with official POH calculations
- Implement unit tests for calculation functions
- Add manual verification examples

### Performance
- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Debounce input updates
- Optimize chart rendering with Recharts best practices

### Mobile UX
- Test on actual devices early
- Implement touch-friendly input controls
- Ensure charts are readable on small screens

### Browser Compatibility
- Test on major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Use CSS fallbacks for advanced features
- Implement graceful degradation

This plan provides a structured approach to building the application incrementally, with each phase building on the previous one and clear milestones to track progress.
