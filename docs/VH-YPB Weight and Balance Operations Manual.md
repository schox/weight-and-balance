Based on the documents provided, I have extracted the specific weight and balance data for your aircraft (VH-YPB) and the general calculation procedures and limitations for the Cessna 182T Nav III.  
Here is a thorough breakdown of the requirements and calculations.

### 1\. Specific Data for Aircraft VH-YPB

According to the **Load Data Sheet** prepared by D. MacArthur & Associates (dated 01-Nov-11), this specific airframe has the following baseline data. You must use these exact figures as the starting point for any calculation.

* **Registration:** VH-YPB (Serial No. 18281728\) 1\.  
* **Configuration:** Four Seats Total 1\.  
* **Basic Empty Weight:** **2007.0 lbs** (910.38 kg) 1\.  
* *Includes:* Unusable fuel, full engine oil, and all fixed equipment (like the G1000 avionics, KAP 140 Autopilot, and wheel fairings) 1, 2\.  
* **Empty Center of Gravity (Arm):** **38.4 inches** (975 mm) aft of datum 1\.  
* **Empty Moment:** **77,006 in-lbs** (887,208 kg-mm) 1\.

**Critical Warning:** The Load Data Sheet includes a specific note in red text: **"NOTE: AFT LIMIT CAN BE EXCEEDED"** 1\. This indicates that with heavy rear passengers and baggage, this specific aircraft is prone to falling out of the rear CG limit.

### 2\. Operational Weight Limits (Cessna 182T)

These are the certified limits you must stay within once passengers, fuel, and cargo are added 3, 4\.

* **Maximum Ramp Weight:** 3,110 lbs.  
* **Maximum Takeoff Weight:** 3,100 lbs.  
* **Maximum Landing Weight:** 2,950 lbs.

**Note:** You must burn off at least **150 lbs** (approx. 25 gallons of fuel) before landing if you take off at Maximum Ramp Weight to be legal for the Maximum Landing Weight 5\.

### 3\. Loading Stations and Arms

To calculate the Center of Gravity (CG), you multiply the weight of each item by its "Arm" (distance from the reference datum, which is the front face of the firewall) to get the Moment.

* **Pilot & Front Passenger:** Station **37** (Adjustable 32" to 50") 6\.  
* **Rear Passengers:** Station **74** (Adjustable 65" to 82") 6\.  
* **Baggage Area A:** Station **97** (Max 120 lbs) 3, 6\.  
* **Baggage Area B:** Station **116** (Max 80 lbs) 3, 6\.  
* **Baggage Area C:** Station **129** (Max 80 lbs) 3, 6\.  
* *Note:* The maximum combined weight for all baggage areas is **200 lbs** 3\.  
* **Usable Fuel:** Station **46.5** 6\.

### 4\. Calculation Procedure

To verify if you are within limits for a specific flight, follow this standard tabular method used in the POH 7:

1. **Start** with the VH-YPB Empty Weight, Moment, and Arm (2007 lbs / 77006 moment).  
2. **Add** Pilot and Front Passenger Weight. Calculate Moment (Weight x 37).  
3. **Add** Rear Passenger Weight. Calculate Moment (Weight x 74).  
4. **Add** Baggage Weight. Calculate Moment (Weight x 97/116/129).  
5. **Add** Usable Fuel Weight (6 lbs/gallon). Calculate Moment (Weight x 46.5).  
6. **Sum** the Total Weight and Total Moment.

**Verification:**

* **Weight Check:** Ensure Total Weight \< 3,110 lbs (Ramp) and \< 3,100 lbs (Takeoff).  
* **CG Check:** Locate your Total Weight and Total Moment on the **Center of Gravity Moment Envelope** chart 5\. If the intersection point falls within the shaded box, you are within balance.

### 5\. Center of Gravity Limits

If you are calculating mathematically rather than using the graph, the CG Limits (Arm) are:

* **Forward Limit:** 33.0 inches aft of datum at 2,250 lbs or less. This limit tapers linearly to 40.9 inches at 3,100 lbs 4\.  
* **Aft Limit:** 46.0 inches aft of datum at all weights 4\.

### 6\. Specific Equipment Notes

The equipment list confirms VH-YPB is equipped with the following items which are already accounted for in the empty weight, but act as a reference for capability:

* **G1000 Avionics Suite** (PFD, MFD, GIA 63 units) 2\.  
* **KAP 140 Autopilot** (2-Axis) 2\.  
* **Wheel Fairings** (Speed fairings) 2\.  
* **Variable Loading:** The aircraft has a 4-seat configuration. If rear seats are removed for cargo, different station arms apply (See Figure 6-5 in POH) 6\.

### 7\. Warnings and Safety

* **Fuel Burn:** Remember that as you burn fuel, the weight decreases. Because the fuel tank Arm (46.5") is generally forward of the rear passengers and baggage, burning fuel may shift the CG slightly aft. Given the specific warning for VH-YPB regarding the aft limit, you should validate the CG for both **Takeoff** and **Landing** (Zero Fuel) conditions to ensure you do not slip out of the aft limit during flight 7\.  
* **Cargo Net:** A baggage net is provided and required to secure items in the aft baggage areas 8\.
